pimd is a lightweight, stand-alone PIM-Sparse Mode
implementation that may be freely distributed or deployed.  
pimd implements the full PIM-SM specification (RFC 2362)
with a few noted exceptions (see the RELEASE.NOTES).

pimd is currently ALPHA-version software that still 
requires extensive testing.  If you choose to use it, send any 
comments or bug reports to pavlin@catarina.usc.edu

pimd should compile and run on most UNIX varieties, including
FreeBSD, BSDI, NetBSD, SunOS, IRIX, Solaris 2.5, Solaris 2.6, and Linux
(however it has not yet been tested on all these).

The software and information may be obtained from the website of
the University of Southern California's
Computer Networks and Distributed Systems Research Lab
