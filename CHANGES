 BUG FIX:
  - Don't ignore PIM Null Register messages if the IP version of the
    inner header is not valid.
  - Add a missing bracket inside rsrr.c (a bug report and a fix
    by <seyon@oullim.co.kr>)

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.18, Wed May 21 03:25:36 PDT 2003
 CHANGES:
  - Compilation fix for Solaris 8 (though, no guarantee pimd still works
    on that platform).
  - Define BYTE_ORDER (if missing).
  - Update include/netinet/pim.h file with its lastest version
  - Update the copyright message of include/netinet/pim_var.h

 CHANGES:
  - Integrated the latest Debian patches from pimd_2.1.0-alpha29.17-9.diff.gz
  - Fixed the new file include/linux/netinet/in-my.h (Debian) so that the
    #else fallback uses the system netinet/in.h, which seems to work now.
  - Bumped version number, this code has been available for a while now.

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.17, Thu Mar 20 17:50:01 PST 2003
 CHANGES:
  - The mrouted license (LICENSE.mrouted) updated with BSD-like
    license!! Thanks to the OpenBSD folks for the 2 years of hard
    work to make this happen:
    http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.sbin/mrouted/LICENSE
 CLARIFICATION:
  - Move the pimd contact email address upfront in README.
    Let me repeat that here:
    If you have any questions, suggestions, bug reports, etc.,
    do NOT send them to the PIM IETF Working Group mailing list!
    Instead, use the contact email address specified in README.

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.16, Tue Feb 18 10:45:59 PST 2003
 BUG FIX:
  - Compilation bugfix for Linux
    (bug report by Serdar Uezuemcue <serdar@eikon.tum.de>)

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.15, Wed Feb 12 12:27:22 PST 2003
 BUG FIX:
  - Routing socket descriptor leak
    (bug report and fix by SUZUKI Shinsuke <suz@crl.hitachi.co.jp>;
     incorporated back from pim6sd)
  - PIM join does not go upstream
    (bug report and fix by SUZUKI Shinsuke <suz@crl.hitachi.co.jp>;
     incorporated back from pim6sd)
    [problem]
    PIM join does not go upstream in the following topology, because oif-list
    is NULL after subtracting iif from oif-list.

        receiver---rtr1---|
                   rtr2---|---rtr3----sender

                rtr1's nexthop to sender = rtr2
                rtr2's nexthop to sender = rtr3

    [reason]
    Owing to a difference between RFC2362 and the new pim-sm draft.
    [solution]
    Prunes iif from oiflist when installing it into kernel, instead of
    PIM route calculation time.

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.14, Mon Feb 10 11:48:07 PST 2003
  BUG FIX:
  - Bugfix in calculating the netmask for POINTOPOINT interface in config.c
    (bug report by "J.W. (Bill) Atwood" <bill@cs.concordia.ca>)
  - SERIOUS bugfix in calculating the RP per group when there are
    a number of group prefixes in the Cand-RP set
    (the change is in rp_grp_match() in rp.c).
    (bug report by "Eva Pless" <eva.pless@imk.fraunhofer.de>)

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.13, Thu Nov  7 10:56:30 PST 2002

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.12, Thu Sep 26 14:17:26 PDT 2002
  BUG FIX:
  - Increase the size of the sending buffers in the kernel.
    (bug report by Andrea Gambirasio <andrea.gambirasio@softsolutions.it>)

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.11, Mon Jul  8 10:22:21 PDT 2002
  BUG FIX:
    Bug reports and fixes by SAKAI Hiroaki <sakai.hiroaki@finet.fujitsu.com>:
  - init_routesock() bugfix: initializing a forgotten variable
    The particular code related to that variable is commented-out
    by default, but a bug is a bug.
  - main.c:restart() bugfix: close the udp_socket only when it is
    is different from igmp_socket.
  - main.c:main() if SIGHUP signal is received, reconstruct readers and nfds
  - Three serious bug fixes in pim_proto.c (thanks to
    "Jiahao Wang" <jiahaow@yahoo.com.cn> and
    "Bo Cheng" <bobobocheng@hotmail.com>):
    * In receive_pim_join_prune(), two bugfixes related to the
      processing of (*,*,RP).
    * Bugfix in add_jp_entry() regarding adding prune entries.
    
  - Remove the FTP URL from the various README files, and replace it
    with an HTTP URL, because the FTP server on catarina.usc.edu
    is not operational anymore.

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.10, Fri Apr 26 18:08:32 PDT 2002
  BUG FIX:
  - Widen the space for "Subnet" addresses printed under
    "Virtual Interface Table"
  - Added (commented-out code) to enable different interfaces
    to belong to overlapping subnets. See around line 200 in config.c
  - Bugfix in handling Join/Prune message when there is one join and
    one Prune for the same group (thanks to Xiaofeng Liu
    <liu_xiao_feng@yahoo.com>).

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.9, Tue Nov 13 12:50:21 PST 2001
  BUG FIX:
  - Increase the config line buffer size to 1024
    (Bug fix by Hiroyuki Komatsu <komatsu@taiyaki.org>)
  NEW FUNCTIONALITIES:
  - Print line number if there is config. line error
  - If there is an error in the config. file, pimd won't start.
  - GRE configuration examples added to README.config
    (The above three entries were contributed by
     Hiroyuki Komatsu <komatsu@taiyaki.org>)
  - New file README.debug (still very short though).

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.8, Sun Sep 16 17:37:10 PDT 2001
  NEW FUNCTIONALITIES:
  - Better log messages for point-to-point links in config.c
    (thanks to Hitoshi Asaeda <asaeda@yamato.ibm.com>)

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.7, Mon Sep 10 13:32:04 PDT 2001
  BUG FIX:
  - Memory leaks bugs fixed in rp.c
    (Thanks to Sri V <vallepal@yahoo.com>).
  - Compilation problems for RedHat-7.1 fixed
    (bug report by Philip Ho <cbho@ie.cuhk.edu.hk>)
  - pid computation fixed (it should be recomputed after a child fork())
    (thanks to Marian Stagarescu <marian@bile.cidera.com>)
  - find_route()-related bug fixes (always explicitly check for NULL return)
    (bug report by Marian Stagarescu <marian@bile.cidera.com>)
  - Bug fix re. adding a local member with older ciscos (in add_leaf())
    (bug report by Marian Stagarescu <marian@bile.cidera.com>)
  - Added explicit check whether BYTE_ORDER in pimd.h is defined
    (bug report by <mistkhan@indiatimes.com>)

 NEW FUNCTIONALITIES:
  - Added "phyint altnet" (see pimd.conf for usage) for allowing some
    senders look like directly connected to a local subnet
    (implemented by Marian Stagarescu <marian@bile.cidera.com>).
  - Added "phyint scoped" (see pimd.conf for usage) for
    administartively disabling the forwarding of multicast groups
    (implemented by Marian Stagarescu <marian@bile.cidera.com>).

 CHANGES:
  - The License has changed from the original USC to the more
    familiar BSD-like (the KAME+OpenBSD guys brought to my attention
    that the original working in the USC license "...and without fee..."
    is ambiguous and makes it sound that noone can distribute pimd
    as part of some other software distribution and charge for that
    distribution.
  - RSRR disabled by default in Makefile

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.6, Fri May  4 08:54:37 PDT 2001
  BUG FIX:
   - Bug fixes in processing Join/Prune messages.
     (Thanks to Sri V <vallepal@yahoo.com>)

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.5, Thu Feb 22 05:05:40 PST 2001
  BUG FIX:
   - When there is a new member, add_leaf() is called by IGMP code
     for any router, not only for a DR. The reason is because
     not only the DR must know about local members, but the last-hop
     router as well (so eventually it will initiate a SPT switch).
     Similar fixes to add_leaf() inside route.c as well.
     Problem reported by Hitoshi Asaeda <asaeda@yamato.ibm.com>.
     XXX: Note the lenghty comment in the beginning of add_leaf()
     about a pimd desing problem that may result in SPT switch
     not initiated immediately by the last-hop router.

   - DR entry timer bug fix in timer.c:
     When (*,G)'s iif and (S,G)'s iif are not same, (S,G)'s timer for the
     DR doesn't increase (reported indirectly by
     toshiaki.nakatsu@fujixerox.co.jp).

  CHANGES:
   - VIFM_FORWARDER() macro renamed to VIFM_LASTHOP_ROUTER.

   - Mini-FAQ entries added to README.

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.4, Fri Dec  1 06:26:32 PST 2000
  BUG FIX:
   - Fix the ordering of 'MRT_PIM' and 'MRT_DONE' in k_stop_pim() in kern.c
     (thanks to Hitoshi Asaeda <asaeda@yamato.ibm.co.jp>).
   - mrtentry creation logic bug fix in add_leaf() in route.c:
     If the router is not a DR, a mrtentry is never created
     (thanks to Hitoshi Asaeda <asaeda@yamato.ibm.co.jp> &
      (indirectly) toshiaki.nakatsu@fujixerox.co.jp)
   - Two critical bug fixes in pim_proto.c:
     J/P prune suppression related message and J/P message with
     (*,*,RP) entry inside
     (thanks to Azzurra Pantella <s198804@studenti.ing.unipi.it> and
     Nicola Dicosmo from University of Pisa)
   - BSR-related fix from Kame's pim6sd in pim_proto.c receive_pim_bootstrap():
     Even when the BSR changes, just schedule an immediate advertisemnet of
     C-RP-ADV, instead of sending message, in order to avoid sending the
     advertisement to the old BSR.
     (in response to a comment from toshiaki.nakatsu@fujixerox.co.jp)

  CHANGES:
   - README cleanup + Mini-FAQ added
   - printf argument cleanup in igmp_proto.c (courtesy KAME)
   - forgotten printf argument in restart() in main.c added (courtesy KAME)

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.3, Fri Oct 13 05:41:24 PDT 2000
  BUG FIX:
   - ADVANCE() bug fix in routesock.c (if your system doesn't have SA_LEN)
     (thanks to "Eric S. Johnson" <esj@cs.fiu.edu>)

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.2, Fri Oct 13 05:41:24 PDT 2000
  NEW FUNCTIONALITIES:
    NOTENOTENOTE: THIS pimd VERSION WON'T WORK WITH OLDER PIM-SM
    KERNEL PATCHES (kernel patches released prior to this version)!!!!
  - The daemon that the kernel will prepare completely the inner
    multicast packet for PIM register messages that the kernel
    is supposer to encapsulate and send to the RP.
  - Now pimd compiles on OpenBSD-2.7. PIM control messages exchange
    test passed (don't have the infrastructure to perform more
    complete testing).
  - Send PIM_HELLO with holdtime of '0' if pimd is going away
    (in main.c cleanup())
    (thanks to JINMEI Tatuya <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>).

  BUG FIX:
  - RANDOM()-related bug fix re. jp_value calculation in pim_proto.c
    (thanks to JINMEI Tatuya <jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>).
  - realloc() related memory leak bug in config_vifs_from_kernel()
    in config.c (courtesy Kame's pim6sd code)
  - Solaris-8 fixes (thanks to "Eric S. Johnson" <esj@cs.fiu.edu>)
  - BROKEN_CISCO_CHECKSUM bug fix (thanks to
    "Eric S. Johnson" <esj@cs.fiu.edu> and Hitoshi Asaeda).
  - 1000000 usec -> 1 sec 0 usec; fix in main.c (courtesy Kame)
  - restart() fixup (in main.c) (courtesy Kame)
  - various min. message length check for the received control messages
    (courtesy Kame). XXX: the pimd check is not enough!
  - vif name string comparison fix in getmsg() (routesock.c); courtesy Kame
  - missing brackets added inside age_routes() (a bug that will show up
    only if KERNEL_MFC_WC_G was defined); courtesy Kame
 
  CHANGES:
  - 'include/netinet/pim.h' updated
  - pimd code adapted to the new 'struct pim' definition.
  - Added PIM_OLD_KERNEL and BROKEN_CISCO_CHECKSUM entries in the Makefile.
  - Don't ignore kernel signals if any of src or dst are NULL.
  - Don't touch ip_id on a PIM register message
  - README cleanup (kernel patches location, obsoleted systems
    clarification, etc)
  - k_stop_pim() added to cleanup() in main.c (courtesy Kame)

* Version 2.1.0-alpha28, Wed Mar 15 21:38:23 PST 2000
  BUG FIX:
  - Fixes to enable point-to-point interfaces being added correctly
    (thanks to "Venning, Roger" <Roger.Venning@corpmail.telstra.com.au>)
  - A number of minor bug fixes
  CHANGES:
  - added #ifdef BROKEN_CISCO_CHECKSUM (disabled by default) to make
    cisco RPs happy (read the comments in pim.c)
  - added #ifdef PIM_TYPEVERS_DECL in netinet/pim.h as a workaround
    that ANSI-C doesn't guarantee that bit-fields are tightly packed
    together (although all modern C compilers should not create a
    problem).
 
* Version 2.1.0-alpha27, Fri Jan 21 05:41:42 PST 2000
  BUG FIX:
  - Bug fix in rp.c add_grp_mask() and delete_grp_mask() : in some
    cases if the RPs are configured with nested multicast prefixes,
    the add/delete may fail. Thanks to Hitoshi Asaeda and the KAME
    team for pointing this one.
  NB: this release may the the lastest one from 2.1.0. The next release
  will be 2.2.0 and there will be lots of changes inside.

* Version 2.1.0-alpha26, Thu Oct 28 23:29:37 PDT 1999
  BUG FIX:
  - Bug fix in receive_pim_register() in pim_proto.c: ntohl() was missing
    inside IN_MULTICAST(). Thanks to Fred Griffoul <griffoul@ccrle.nec.de>
  - Bug report and fix by Hitoshi Asaeda <asaeda@yamato.ibm.co.jp>
    inside receive_pim_cand_rp_adv() (if a router is not a BSR). Another
    bug in rp.c (delete_grp_mask_entry()): an entry not in the head of the list     was not deleted propertly.
  - Some VIFF_TUNNEL checks added or deleted in various places.
    Slowly preparing pimd to be able to work with GRE tunnels...

* Version 2.1.0-alpha25, Mon Aug 30 19:56:08 PDT 1999
  BUG FIX:
  - Bug reports and fixes by Hitoshi Asaeda <asaeda@yamato.ibm.co.jp>
    inside parse_reg_threshold() and parse_data_threshold() in config.c
  - Test is performed whether a PIM_REGISTER has invalid source and/or
    group address of the internal packet (bug report and fix by Hitoshi
    Asaeda)
  CHANGES:
  - Successfully added multicast prefixes configured in pimd.conf
    are printed during startup
  - include/freebsd defaults for freebsd-3.x include files
    include/freebsd2 contains the freebsd-2.x include files

* Version 2.1.0-alpha24, Mon Aug  9 11:31:23 PDT 1999
  CHANGES:
  - PIM_DEFAULT_CAND_RP_ADV_PERIOD definition set to 60, but
    default 'time' value for inter Cand-RP messages is set in
    pimd.conf to 30
  - PIM_REGISTER checksum verification in receive_pim_register()
    relaxed for compatibility with some older routers.
    The checksum has to be computed only over the first 8 bytes
    of the PIM Register (i.e. only over the header), but some older
    routers might compute it over the whole packet. Hence, the
    checksum verification is over the first 8 bytes first, and if
    if it fails, then over the whole packet. Thus, pimd that is RP
    should still work with older routers that act as DR, but if
    an older router is the RP, then pimd cannot be the DR.
    Sorry, don't know which particular routers and models create
    the checksum over the whole PIM Register (if there are still
    any left).
    
* Version 2.1.0-alpha23, Mon May 24 16:05:47 PDT 1999
  NEW FUNCTIONALITIES:
  - Finally pimd works under Linux (probably 2.1.126, 2.2.x and 2.3.x)
    However, probably there is need for small "fix" in the kernel:
    File linux/net/ipv4/ipmr.c, function pim_rcv():

    Note that these 'preference' and 'metric' are like per iif.
  CHANGES:
  - MRT_PIM used (again) instead of MRT_ASSERT in kern.c, and
    added the following:
   #ifndef MRT_PIM
   #define MRT_PIM MRT_ASSERT
   #endif
    The problem is that Linux has both MRT_ASSERT and MRT_PIM, while
    *BSD has only MRT_ASSERT
  - "__bsdi__" (defined by the OS) used instead of -DBSDI in Makefile
    (change by Hitoshi Asaeda). Similarly, __FreeBSD__ used instead of
    -DFreeBSD
  - zero_vif() added in vif.c
  - Linux patches by Fred Griffoul <griffoul@ccrle.nec.de> including
    a netlink.c instead of routesock.c 
  BUG FIX:
  (all bug reports thanks to Kaifu Wu <kaifu@3com.com>)
  - Linux-related bug fixes regarding raw IP packets byte ordering
  - "Join/Prune" message bug fixed if the message contains several
   groups joined/pruned

* Version 2.1.0-alpha22, Wed Nov 11 16:23:29 PST 1998
  BUG FIX:
  - Bug fixes to compile under newer Linux kernel (linux-2.1.127)
    To compile for older kernels ( ver < ???), add -Dold_Linux to the
    Makefile
  - For convenience, the include/linux/netinet/{in.h,mroute.h} files are
    added, with few modifications applied.
  (Bug reports by "Jonathan Day" <jd9812@my-dejanews.com>)

* Version 2.1.0-alpha21, Wed Nov  4 10:56:52 PST 1998
  BUG FIX:
  - bug fixes in join_or_prune() (pim_proto.c) in case of (S,G)
    overlapping with (*,G)
    (bug report by Dirk Ooms <Dirk.Ooms@alcatel.be>)
  - Join/Prune (*,G), (*,*,RP) fire timer optimization/fix in
    change_interfaces() in route.c

* Version 2.1.0-alpha20, Wed Aug 26 13:45:54 PDT 1998
  BUG FIX:
  - fix TIMEOUT definitions in difs.h (bug report by Nidhi Bhaskar)
    (originally, if timer value less than 5 seconds, it won't become 0)
  It is HIGHLY recommended to apply that fix, so here it is:
-------------BEGIN BUG FIX-------------------
  1) Add the following lines to defs.h (after #define FALSE):

#ifndef MAX
#define MAX(a,b) (((a) >= (b))? (a) : (b))
#define MIN(a,b) (((a) <= (b))? (a) : (b))
#endif /* MAX & MIN */

  2) Change the listed below TIMEOUT macros to:

#define IF_TIMEOUT(timer)		\
	if (!((timer) -= (MIN(timer, TIMER_INTERVAL))))

#define IF_NOT_TIMEOUT(timer)		\
	if ((timer) -= (MIN(timer, TIMER_INTERVAL)))

#define TIMEOUT(timer)			\
	(!((timer) -= (MIN(timer, TIMER_INTERVAL))))

#define NOT_TIMEOUT(timer)		\
	((timer) -= (MIN(timer, TIMER_INTERVAL)))
---------------END BUG FIX-------

  CHANGES:
  - (Almost) all timers manipulation now use macros
  - pim.h and pim_var.h are in separate common directory
  - added BSDI definition to pim_var.h (thanks to Hitoshi Asaeda)

* Version 2.1.0-alpha19, Wed Jul 29 11:15:28 PDT 1998
  BUG FIX:
  - bug fix in find_route() when searching for (*,*,RP)
  - bug fix in move_kernel_cache(): no need to do move_kernel_cache()
    from (*,*,R) to (*,G) first when we call move_kernel_cache() for (S,G)
    (both bug reports by Chirayu Shah (shahzad@torrentnet.com))

* Version 2.1.0-alpha18, Fri May 29 18:50:10 PDT 1998
  CHANGES:
  - Now compiles under Linux (haven't check whether the PIMv2 kernel
   support in linux-2.1.103 works)
  BUG FIX:
  - parse_default_source*() bug fix 
  (bug reports by Nidhi Bhaskar)
  - allpimrouters deleted from igmp.c (already defined in pim.c)
  - igmpmsg defined for IRIX 

* Version 2.1.0-alpha17, Thu May 21 19:12:14 PDT 1998
  NEW FUNCTIONALITIES:
  - (*,G) MFC kernel support completed and verified
    Compile with KERNEL_MFC_WC_G defined in Makefile, but then must use it
    only with a kernel that supports (*,G), e.g. pimkern-PATCH_7.
    Currently, kernel patches available for FreeBSD and SunOS only.

  BUG FIX:
  - MRTF_MFC_CLONE_SG flag set after delete_single_kernel_cache() is called
 
* Version 2.1.0-alpha16, Tue May 19 16:37:23 PDT 1998
  NEW FUNCTIONALITIES:
  - PIM registers kernel encapsulation support
    (compile with PIM_REG_KERNEL_ENCAP defined in Makefile)
  - (*,G) MFC support
    (compile with KERNEL_MFC_WC_G defined in Makefile. However, MFC_WC_G
    is still not supported with pimkern-PATCH_6, so for now must disable it)

  CHANGES:
  - new function in mrt.c: delete_single_kernel_cache_addr()
    Uses source, group to specify a MFC to be deleted

* Version 2.1.0-alpha15, May 14, 1998
  - few bug fixes related to NetBSD definitions 
    (thanks to Heiko W.Rupp <hwr@pilhuhn.de>)

* Version 2.1.0-alpha14, May 12, 1998
  - few bug fixes related to NetBSD definitions 
    (thanks to Heiko W.Rupp <hwr@pilhuhn.de>)

* Version 2.1.0-alpha13, May 11, 1998
  NEW FUNCTIONALITIES:
  - If the RP changes, the necessary actions are taken to pass the
    new RP address to the kernel. To be used for kernel register encap.
    support. Wnat needs to be done is: (a) add rp_addr entry to the
    mfcctl structure, and then just set it in k_chf_mfc() (in kern.c)
    Obviously, the kernel needs to support the register encapsulation
    (instead of sending WHOLEPKT to the user level). In the near few
    days will make the necessary kernel changes.

  BUG FIX:

  CHANGES:
  - added "flags" argument for change_interfaces(). The only valid flag
    is MFC_UPDATE_FORCE: used for forcing kernel call when only the RP
    changes.
  - k_chg_mfc() has a new argument: rp_addr. To be used for kernel register
    encapsulation support
  - MRT_PIM completely replaced by MRT_ASSERT
  - MFC_MOVE_FORCE (an argument to move_kernel_cache()
    is a flag instead of TRUE/FALSE
  - removed unneeded piece of code from process_cache_miss()

* Version 2.1.0-alpha12, May 10, 1998
   NEW FUNCTIONALITIES:
   - added default_source_metric and default_source_preference (1024)
     because the kernel's unicast routing table is not a good source
     of info; configurable in pimd.conf
   - now can compile under NetBSD-1.3
     (thanks to "Heiko W.Rupp" <hwr@pilhuhn.de>)
   BUG FIX:
   - the incorrect setup of the borderBit and nullRegisterBit (different for
     big/little endian machines) fixed; *_BORDER_BIT and *NULL_REGISTER_BIT
     are redefined
   - don't send pim_assert on tunnels or register vifs (if for whatever
     reason we receive on such interface)
   - ignore WRONGVIF messages for register and tunnel vifs (the cleaned up
     kernel mods dont send such signal, but the older (before May 9 '98) pimd
     mods that signaling was enabled

   CHANGES:
   - Uses the cleaned up netinet/pim.h
   - Remove the no needed anymore pim header definition in pimd.h
   - Don't use anymore MRT_PIM (replaced back with MRT_ASSERT) (in kern.c)

* Version 2.1.0-alpha11, Mar 16, 1998
   NEW FUNCTIONALITIES:

   BUG FIX:
   - timer.c: age_routes(): bunch of fixes regarding J/P message
     fragmentation
   - route.c: process_wrong_iif(): (S,G) SPT switch bug fix:
     ANDed MRTF_RP fixed to ~MRTF_RP
   - pim_proto.c, timer.c: (S,G) Prune now is sent toward RP, when iif
     toward S and iif toward RP are different
   - pim_proto.c: join_or_prune() bug fixes
   - pim_proto.c: (S,G)Prune entry's timer now set to J/P message holdtime
   - pim_proto.c: receive_pim_join_prune(): the pruned interfaces are
     correctly reestablished
   - timer.c: age_routes(): now (S,G) entry with local members
     (inherited from (*,G)) is timeout propertly
   - timer.c: age_routes(): (S,G) J/P timer restarted propertly
   - timer.c: age_routes(): check also the (S,G)RPbit entries in the
     forwarders and RP and eventually switch to the shortest path if data
     rate too high 
   - route.c: process_wrong_vif() fire J/P timer
   - route.c: switch_shortest_path(): reset the iif toward S if there is
     already (S,G)RPbit entry

   CHANGES:
   - new function find_vif_direct_local() (vif.c). Used in routesock.c,
     igmp_proto.c
   - mrt.c, route.c, pim_proto.c:
     use MFC_MOVE_FORCE/MFC_MOVE_DONT_FORCE flag when
     need to move the kernel cache entries between (*,*,RP), (*,G), (S,G)
   - new timer related macros: SET_TIMER(), FIRE_TIMER(),
     IF_TIMER_SET(), IF_TIMER_NOT_SET()


* Version 2.1.0-alpha10, Mar 3, 1998 (temp. non-public release)
   NEW FUNCTIONALITIES:
   - `interval` can be applied for data rate check. 
     The statement in pimd.conf that only the default value will be used is
     not true anymore.
   - The RP-initiated and the forwarder-initiated (S,G) switch threshold rate
     can be different.

   BUG FIX:
   - mrt.c: add_kernel_cache(): no kernel cache duplicates
   - mrt.c: move_kernel_cache(): if the iif of the (*,*,R) (or (*,G))
     and (S,G) are different, dont move the cache entry "UP"
   - timer.c: age_routes(): (S,G) add_jp_entry() flag fixed (SPT switch
     related)
   - kern.c: k_get_sg_cnt modified to compensate for the kernel's return code
     bug for SIOCGETSGCNT (getting (S,G) byte count)
   - pim_proto.c: receive_pim_register(): if the (S,G) oif is NULL, now
     checks whether the iif is register_vif

   CHANGES:
   - pim_proto.c: receive_pim_register(): check if I am the RP for that group,
     and if "no", send PIM_REGISTER_STOP (XXX: not in the spec, but should be!)
     receive_pim_register_stop(): check if the PIM_REGISTER_STOP originator
     is really the RP, before suppressing the sending of the PIM registers.
     (XXX: not in the spec but should be there)
   - new function added to rp.c: check_mrtentry_rp(): checks whether the RP
     address is the corresponding one for the given mrtentry
   - debug.c: timer values added to dump_mrt()
   - route.c: add_leaf(), process_cache_miss(), process_wrong_iif():
     no routing entries created for the LAN scoped addresses
   - DEBUG_DVMRP_DETAIL and DEBUG_PIM_DETAIL added

* Version 2.1.0-alpha9, Feb 18, 1997
   - "non-commersial" statement deleted from the copyright message
   - mrinfo support added
   - mtrace support added (not completed and not enough tested)
   - if invalid local address for cand_rp or cand_bootstrap_router in
     pimd.conf, automatically will use the largest local multicast enabled
     address
   - "include" directory for FreeBSD and SunOS added, so now pimd
     can be compiled without having the necesary "include" files added to
     your system. Probably a bad idea and may remove it later.
   - some default values for the IP headers of the IGMP and PIM packets are
     fixed
   - VIFF_PIM_NBR and VIFF_DVMRP_NBR flags added
   - VIFF_REGISTER now included in the RSRR vifs report
   - small fixes in debug.c
   - find_route() debug messages removed
   - #ifdef for HAVE_SA_LEN corrected

     (the kernel patches will be available soon)
   - improved debug messages format (thanks to Hitoshi Asaeda)
   - A new function netname() for network IP address print instead
     of inet_fmts() (thanks to Hitoshi Asaeda)
   - pimd.conf format changed

* Version 2.1.0-alpha6, Nov 20, 1997
   - many bug fixes: remove the inherited leaves from (S,G) when a receiver
     drops membership, some parameters when calling change_interface() fixed,
     use send_pim_null_register + take the appropriate action when the
     register suppression timer expires, bug fix related to choosing the
     largest local IP address for little endian machines.

   - pimd.conf: two errors, related to the rate limit fixed 
   - pim_proto.c: bug fix (thanks to SunOS cc warning!) in
